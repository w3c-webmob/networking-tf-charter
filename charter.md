Networking Task Force Charter

The mission of the Networking Task Force, part of the W3C Web and Mobile Interest Group, is to evaluate opportunities where better integration with the underlying network can help Web applications achieve a better user experience.

* Confidentiality: Proceedings are Public
* TF Leader: TBD

## Scope

The Networking Task Force is a forum where network operators, network equipment manufacturers, browser vendors and Web developers work together to discuss use cases and requirements regarding technologies that enable potentially deeper integration between Web applications and the network on which they are served.

Due to the global nature of the Web platform, strong attention will be put on ensuring solutions in this space remain applicable without specific out-of-band agreements between operators, browser vendors and application developers.

The tasks of the group include:

* Surveying and evaluating existing features (e.g. APIs) provided by network operators and see whether and how they could be used in the context of Web applications
* Identifying gaps in features provided by network operators which could further enhance browsers or Web applications
* Reviewing how the evolution of Web technologies impact network management
* Reviewing how the evolution of networking technologies might impact the Web
* Liaising with organizations that are responsible for network operations

## Deliverables
In general, the task force will work on gap analysis, use cases and requirements; in some cases, it might sketch what a particular technical solution might look like, but actual technical work will happen in other W3C groups (e.g. Community Groups or Working Groups), or in other organizations.

The task force is expected to deliver documents at least on the following topics:

* Data Plan Info API: use cases and requirements for an API to let Web applications adapt their network usage to the data plan under which their user is on
* Network Optimization API: use cases and requirements for an API to let Web applications (or browsers?) adapt their network usage to the particularities of the specific network theyâ€™re running on (e.g. determine what pattern the radio usage should follow)
* Bundling of network requests and security: performance considerations, HTTP2, Content-Security-Policy are potentially pushing changes in different directions with regard to how web app developers should deliver their Web apps (e.g. as one or many files); the task force should review and document these competing constraints.
* Impact of Web technologies on network management: a review of how various Web technologies (e.g. Web sockets, WebRTC, Push) impact the management of mobile networks
* Network evolution roadmap: a roadmap of the expected evolution of mobile networks which have potential impacts on Web applications

## Communication
The current expectation is that most of the work will happen on the Web and Mobile Interest Group public-web-mobile@w3.org list, supported by the usage of Github repositories as needed.
